# Digital Communications Project-2021

## Convolutional Coding and the Viterbi Algorithm

#### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide you with a deeper understanding of how channel coding can be used to improve the performance of a digital communication system. Your main task is to implement, evaluate, and compare several options for different encoders and modulation formats. In order to successfully complete this task, you have to program certain algorithms (like the Viterbi algorithm), as well as answer specific questions with the help of concepts introduced in the lectures (like channel capacity).The deliverables of the project are split into two parts. For the first part (due Friday, December 10, 2021,11:59pm), you have to submit the source code of your implementation of the Viterbi algorithm together with a figure showing the requested simulation results. For the second part (due Friday, January 7, 2022,11:59pm), the source code and a final report have to be handed in. The report should document all your answers and simulation results, as well as a detailed discussion thereof. For more details, see Section 3 below.

#### Learning Outcomes 

After completing this project, you should be able to

- successfully set up and run a simulation environment efficiently in MATLAB,
- understand why and how MATLAB can be used to simulate the performance of a system that eventually transmits and receives analog waveforms,â€¢use the concept of channel capacity as a benchmarking tool 
- encode a bit stream with a convolutional encoder and understand the relationship between the encoder and a trellis diagram
- implement the Viterbi algorithm and understand how it works
- explain and quantify the performance difference between hard and soft decoding
- analyze fundamental trade-offs between power, bit rate, bandwidth, and bit-error rate in a coded digital communication system and in particular make fair comparisons between uncoded and coded systems.
